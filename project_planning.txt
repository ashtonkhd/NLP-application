Current potential project ideas:
  - Simple search tool to retrieve relevant "Python Enhancement Proposals" (PEPs) [Proposed by Matias
    Summanen]
  
    - The problem this would solve is nothing ground-breaking, it is simply "make it less bothersome
      to look up things that are written abount in PEPs".

    - The data to be index would be the PEPs available online. Given their quantity, it would most
      likely be more space efficient to use a module such as "requests" to get the html data directly
      from the relevant PEPs. However, this could make the processing more complicated, or harder to
      impliment.
